# Shared components

ROOL web applications share components that sometimes have to be in well-known locations. In addition to public CSS and image resources which are just served as public static files directly, there are internal components such as fragments of Rails views that may be shared too. This repository holds those components.

Often, the `main` branch will not be interesting - check for any open feature branches, too.
